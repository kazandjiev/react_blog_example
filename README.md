This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Several notes:

  * The build could be customized depending on the requirements;
  * The index.js files in components' directories are there for more straightforward imports and predictability;
  * The styles could be handled better [CSS Modules](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2016/07/css-modules-webpack-react/);
  * Introducing Redux to the mix would be a lot nicer for the delete, update and undo functionality;
